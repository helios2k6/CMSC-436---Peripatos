<!-- Explaination
	Each answer must be associated with three things:
		1. The Student
		2. The Assignment
		3. The Question
		
	Since it is possible to re-use questions, we must specify which question on which assignment
	the student wishes to answer.
	
	For instance, the professor may ask the same exact question on a quiz and on a final exam. 
	Therefore, we need to distinguish between which assignment the student meant to answer 
	since we do not want to exempt him from answering the question twice.
