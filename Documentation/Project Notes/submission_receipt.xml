<!-- 
	Explaination
	When the android app sends its answers to the server, the server will response with a "status code" and a list of question ids.

	Status codes: Status codes tell the Android app whether or not the set of answers got properly accepted by the server. 
	
	Possible status codes: 
		1. OK
		2. ERROR
	
	If one or more answers could not be properly processed, the status code returned will be "ERROR".
	
	A status code of "OK" means all of the answers submitted by the Android app were properly mapped to their appropriate question.
