<!-- 
	Explaination
	When the android app sends its answers to the server, the server will response with a "status code" and a list of question ids.

	Status codes: Status codes tell the Android app whether or not the set of answers got properly accepted by the server. 
	Possible status codes: 
		1. OK
		2. ERROR
	
	If one or more answers could not be properly processed, the status code returned will be "ERROR". A status code of "OK" means all 
	of the answers submitted by the Android app were properly mapped to their appropriate question.
	
	When an answer is appropriately mapped to an assignment and a question, the assignment_id and the question_id that the answer mapped to
	is displayed in the response.
